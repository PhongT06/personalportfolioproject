                    I am currently residing in Houston, TX with my beloved wife, our daughter, and our two dogs. 
                    I have embraced the warmth and diversity of this vibrant city for over seven years. My journey 
                    began in Alabama, where, fresh out of the Radiologic Technology program, I was swiftly cross-trained 
                    into a different modality. After earning my Computed Tomography license, Texas became our new home.

                    I have been in the medical field for over a decade. With a rich background in the medical field, my 
                    career has been a testament to the power of compassion, patience, and meticulous attention to detail. 
                    These years of service have not only honed my ability to empathize and connect with individuals from 
                    all walks of life but have also instilled in me a deep appreciation for the intricacies of life and health.

                    As I transition into the world of coding, I carry with me the invaluable lessons learned at the bedside of 
                    patients: the importance of clear communication, the necessity of continuous learning, and the profound 
                    impact of collaborative problem-solving. Coding, much like medicine, is about finding solutions to complex 
                    challenges and improving lives through innovation and dedication.

                    <br>
                    I am excited to merge the analytical skills and the human touch from my medical background with the logical 
                    precision of programming. Iâ€™ve learned that whether in healthcare or coding, the core values of empathy, 
                    learning, and teamwork are universal and invaluable.

                    My favorite past time hobbies include fully immersing myself in the digital landscapes of Final Fantasy 
                    XIV or charting the thoughtful strategies of Civilization VI. To me, each games like those are a portal to a 
                    world of wonder, offering both a peaceful retreat and an exhilarating adventure. I also enjoy diving into the 
                    world of anime and binge watching some good tv shows. Jamming out to good music is a must and I'm thankful for 
                    today's technology that allows me to find new songs to enjoy every week! I definitely can not forget to mention 
                    that I am a BIG foodie that loves to eat all kinds of food and when you pair that with a cold brew, HEAVEN!
